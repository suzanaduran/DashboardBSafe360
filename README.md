# BSafe-360: Dashboard
This repository was created as part of Suzana Duran Bernardes' Ph.D. dissertation. It contains the information needed for reproducing the dashboard for visualizing the BSafe-360 data. The idea behind the development of the dashboard was to have a consolidated view of cycling data collected using the BSafe-360.
